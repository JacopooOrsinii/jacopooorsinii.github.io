Hi, i'm Jacopo Orsini, a passionate Data Scientist. I have a Master’s degree in Data Science from Università di Roma La Sapienza and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Management from Università degli Studi di Milano. My academic journey has allowed me to have competences in machine learning, statistical analysis, and computer vision, alongside practical skills in Python (including libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch), R, and PySpark.

I have applied my knowledge to real-world challenges. At Gambero Rosso spa, I led statistical research on Italian wine prices, identifying significant correlations with expert ratings. More recently, during my time at Octo Telematics spa, I worked on developing a driving app that integrated geospatial data to deliver contextual tips and real-time insights, enhancing user experience.

The points of strength that i want to underline the most are discipline and sense of commitment. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I bring a focused, consistent effort to every task I undertake. I believe that true progress is built through daily habits, perseverance, and staying dedicated even when challenges arise. This way of thinking allows me to stay focused on the balance betweeen the quality of work and the company's deadlines.

This is just a hint of who I am. The rest comes over time, through experiences, challenges, and the connections we build along the way, maybe even by working together.
