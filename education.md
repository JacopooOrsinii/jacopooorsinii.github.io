## Bachelor's degree in Economics and Management at the Università degli Studi di Milano La Statale
I started this program in September 2019 and graduated on time in December 2022 with a final grade of **101/110**. The curriculum was built around 3 core pillars: Statistics, Business Sciences, and Economics. I particularly appreciated this structure as it provided a strong foundation in the fundamentals of economics. Among the subjects, I was especially passionate about Statistics. My thesis was developed within the course **Statistica per il Big Data economico-aziendali**, taught by Professor Giancarlo Manzi. Specifically, I conducted a sentiment analysis on Amazon Alexa product reviews from the official product page, collecting the data through the official API.

## Master's degree in Data Science at the Università di Roma La Sapienza
I attended this two-year program from February 2023 to March 2025, graduating on time with a final grade of **103/110**.

The structure differed from my Bachelor’s degree, with only four mandatory courses and the rest chosen from thematic groups. Many courses have made me feel more passionate about Data Science, some i would like to mention are: 
- **Fundalmentals of Data Science** – Prof. Fabio Galasso: introduction to core Python libraries, basics of Computer Vision, fundamental Machine Learning models (e.g., Linear Regression), and Neural Networks
- **Advanced Data Mining and Language Technology** – Prof. Luca Becchetti & Prof. Fabrizio Silvestri: first part on basic computer science algorithms such as PageRank; second part on Large Language Models and Transformers
- **Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems** – Prof. Walter Quattrociocchi: focused on complex systems and graph theory; I particularly valued the professor’s clear explanations and the alternative perspective offered on Data Science approaches
- **Quantitative Models for Economic Analysis and Management** – Prof. Cinzia Daraio: provided advanced skills for conducting a Systematic Literature Review, a valuable tool for academic research; my Master’s thesis was based on this course

The Master’s program gave me strong knowledge in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I particularly appreciated the group projects in each course, which pushed me out of my comfort zone. Frequently working with new teammates, I received positive feedback on my contributions, which helped me develop teamwork, leadership, and conflict resolution skills.

## Other Courses
I also like to keep strengthening my knowledge and beeing updated on the new technologies by attending other course:
- **Machine Learning and AI with Python, CS109xa** – EdX: focused in particular on Decision Trees and Random Forests
