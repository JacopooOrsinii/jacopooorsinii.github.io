## Bachelor's degree in Economics and Management at the Università degli Studi di Milano La Statle
I started this course in September 2019 and I completed it, in time, in December 2022 with a grade of 101/110. The course was built on 3 subjects' pillars: Statistics, Business sciences and Economical sciences. I particularly liked this type of organisation as long as it allows the students to get a strong knowledge on the basic of Economy. During the path, the subjects related to Statistics were the one that i liked the most. I based my thesis on the subject **Statistica per il Big Data economico aziendali** held by the Professor Giancarlo Manzi, to be more precise, I developed a sentiment analysis on the reviews of Amazon Alexa from the official web page of the product, obtaining them through the official API.

## Master's degree in Data Science at the Università di Roma La Sapienza
I did this 2 years master from February 2023 to March 2025, in time, with a grade of 103/110. The structure of this course was different from the Bachelor's degree, as long as it only had 4 mandatory courses and the rest were chosen by the students among groups of subjects. Many courses have made me feel more passionate about Data Science, some i would like to mention are: 
- **Fundalmentals of Data Science**, held by the Professor Fabio Galasso: in this course the fundamental libaried of Python have been presented together with the basics of Computer Vision, the most important models of Machine Learning, such as the Linear Regression, and the Neural Networks
- **Advanced Data Mining and Language Technology**, held by the Professor Luca Becchetti and the Professor Fabrizio Silvestri: the course, in the first part, introduced the students with some basic informatics algorithms such as Page Rank and in the second part instruced the studets with the Large Language Models and the Transformers
- **Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems**, held by the Professor Walter Quattrociocchi: this course is based on the topic of complex systems and graph theory, i apprecciated it particulary for the Professor's explainations and for the interesting, alternative, point of view on Data Science which has offered, leading to different ways of approaching statistical problems
- **Quantitative Models for Economic Analysis and Management**, held by the Professor Cinzia Daraio: this course offered a strong knowledge on how to build a Systematic Literature Rewview, a tool to develop academich researches; I based my Master's thesis on this course

The Master gave me a strong knowledge on the main topics of Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. A characteristic which I have appreciated a lot was the presence in every course of group projects, which forced me to go out of the comfort zone, in fact, many times I was in group with people I didn't know. I have received many good feedbacks as a component of groups, making me think about how important the human side is, inside a techincal subject like this. This feature has allowed me to start developing and understanding team skills, especially leadership and conflicts resolution.

## Other Coruses
I also like to keep strengthening my knowledge and beeing updated on the new technologies by attending other course:
- **Machine Learning and AI with Python, CS109xa** on the EdX online learning platform: this course is very vertical on the topic of Decision Trees and Random Forest
