During the 3 years of experience with Machine Learning i dedicated my time to different projects.

#### Digital Twins in healthcare and industrial processes
The thesis of my Master's degree was about the development of a Systematic Literature Review on the role of Digital Twins in the healthcare and in the industrial processes, co authored with the Professor Cinzia Daraio and the Professor Simone Di Leo. Digital Twins (DTs) are revolutionizing both healthcare and industrial sectors by creating dynamic, digital replicas of physical systems. These virtual counterparts enable real-time interaction, simulation, and analysis, transforming processes from patient-specific medical care to predictive industrial maintenance.

In healthcare, DTs enhance medical training, surgical planning, and personalized treatment through advanced modeling and integration of real-world data. Traditional simulation methods, such as Finite Element Methods (FEM), have been effective but struggle with real-time performance. Emerging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) address this limitation, delivering high-fidelity, interactive simulations suitable for surgical training and planning.

Our bibliometric analysis reveals a significant rise in research interest, driven by advances in AI, immersive technologies (AR/VR), and real-time data processing. Cross-disciplinary collaboration, combining computer science, biomechanics, and medical engineering, is expanding the applicability of DTs in healthcare. Similar trends are observed in industry, where DTs integrate IoT sensors, machine learning, and predictive analytics to optimize production, logistics, and asset management.

Looking ahead, DTs are poised to play a critical role in remote surgery, augmented diagnostics, and personalized medicine. Immersive interfaces, haptic feedback, and sensor-based tracking will further improve realism and adoption. In industrial contexts, these same technologies are driving workforce training, sustainability, energy efficiency, and predictive maintenance.

This work is exemplified through the **Rome Technopole** project **Phygital Twin Technologies for Innovative Surgical Training & Planning**, showcasing real-world applications from training simulators to patient-specific planning tools. The findings emphasize that real-time, high-fidelity simulations are key to widespread adoption, while predictive analytics represent a promising frontier for proactive healthcare interventions.

Although challenges remain, particularly in scalability and interoperability, Digital Twins are emerging as a cornerstone of modern healthcare and industrial systems, offering unprecedented precision, efficiency, and impact across domains.

From this thesis a paper has been originated and published by the **Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management** called **An Integrated And Flexible Review Framework To Evaluate The Evolution And Barriers Of Digital Twin Technologies In Industrial And Healthcare Domains**.

#### Demand Forecasting
This project provides machine learning models for demand forecasting, designed to help manufacturing companies optimize inventory levels, reduce waste, and improve production planning. By predicting future demand with higher accuracy, businesses can enhance operational efficiency and respond proactively to market changes.

Accurate demand forecasting supports strategic decision-making by enabling manufacturers and retailers to:
- Optimize inventory levels, reducing both stockouts and excess stock.
- Improve cash flow and reduce warehousing costs.
- Plan promotions, pricing strategies, and supply chain logistics more effectively.

Machine learning techniques can reveal complex, non-linear patterns in data—such as the effects of promotions, seasonality, and regional trends—that traditional forecasting methods often miss.

Model performance was evaluated using R² Score, RMSE, and MAE. XGBoost delivered the best results:
- R²: 0.81
- RMSE: 18.75
- MAE: 12.02

The baseline Random Forest also performed competitively, balancing accuracy and simplicity. With an average absolute error of just 12 units, the XGBoost model enables businesses to reliably forecast demand, minimizing both stockouts and overstocking.

#### Coaching AI
This project, developed in collaboration with my mentor [Paolo Baldriga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolo-baldriga-ai-strategy/), focuses on customizing a GPT to help reduce university student dropout rates. Addressing this issue is particularly delicate, especially when applying AI in areas with a strong human and empathetic dimension, such as coaching. However, we believe that, if introduced as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for human interaction, AI can bring significant benefits, offering timely guidance, personalized recommendations, and early intervention strategies to support students throughout their academic journey.
