Through this internship experience, I had to conduct research statistics on Italian wine prices, investigating the correlation between prices and theratings obtained by the wines. The Linear Regression was the model at the base of the whole research, due to the performances it provides and the nature of the task itself. One of the things that I appercciated the most was the opportunity to talk and have meetings with the President and CEO of the company.
