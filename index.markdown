# Welcome!

Hi, I'm **Jacopo Orsini**, a Data Scientist with a passion for machine learning, statistics, and turning data into impact. This is my personal website where I share my background, experiences, and projects. I believe in showing up every day with **intention**, not just to get things done, but **to grow through the process**. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new, to refine skills, and to stretch beyond It was thought possible. It is fundamental to approach each step with curiosity, resilience, and positivity, knowing that consistency and a willingness to learn are what **truly drive progress**.
